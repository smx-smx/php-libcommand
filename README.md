# php-libcommand
Small library to run tasks, log the output to files, and send the result via email

You can use this library together with cron to automate tasks and receive the resulting log file by email

Email functionality requires a working MTA/SMTP server (like Postfix), and the <a href="http://www.mutt.org/">mutt client</a> (which is used by this library)
